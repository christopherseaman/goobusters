# Goobusters Tasks

## To Do

- [ ] Local annotaion feedback loop? See references/teef for simpler example app with single annotation type
    - [ ] Server for reviewing/modifying annotations (LABEL_ID, EMPTY_ID, and TRACK_ID)
    - [ ] Save human reviewed/modified free fluid (LABEL_ID), no fluid (EMPTY_ID) annotations outside data/ bc data reflects mdai truth (maybe local db? duckdb with file?); may be better to store as masks (grayscale images) for local iterations, update annotation from masks on tracking runs (think this happens already but may need fixing)
    - [ ] Re-run tracking with locally updated annotations (LABEL_ID & EMPTY_ID annotations, no TRACK_ID; if in local db then don't source mdai annotations json)

## Blocked

- [ ] (BLOCKED: NEED TO CREATE EMPTY FRAME ANNOTATIONS) Check `tracked_annotations` generated by tracking
- [ ] (BLOCKED: NEEDS PRIORITIZATION GO/NO-GO) lib/debug_visualization.py abandoned. If needed, will will have to fix debug viz and reincorporate
- [ ] (BLOCKED: NEED TEAM TO WEIGH IN ON METHODS) Send test annotations back to mdai for the Pelvic-1 dataset (MUST BE PELVIC-1 FOR TESTING, CHECK dot.env VARS TWICE)

## Done

- [x] lib/optical.py cleanup - 1998 lines but only 2 exported functions used (create_identity_file, copy_annotations_to_output). Consider refactoring or removing dead code.
    - lib/optical.py - 90% dead code (1,800 of 1,998 lines)
        - Only 2 functions are actually used: create_identity_file and copy_annotations_to_output
        - Contains entire unused classes: OpticalFlowTracker (1,385 lines), MultiAnnotationProcessor (300 lines)
        - Can be reduced from 1,998 → ~200 lines
        - combine with opticalflowprocessor
    - lib/multi_frame_tracker.py - 25% vestigial code (~250 lines)
        - 13+ instance variables initialized but never used (e.g., tracking_strategy_weight, feedback_loop_mode, tracks, track_id_counter)
        - 4 unused methods: _track_forward, _track_backward, _get_previous_frame, _get_next_frame
        - Logger bugs: self.logger used but never initialized (will cause AttributeError)
    - lib/debug_visualization.py - 100% orphaned (242 lines)
        - Entire file unused, not imported anywhere
        - Should be deleted or moved to debug_tools/
    - lib/video_capture_manager.py - 61% unused (78 of 127 lines)
        - VideoCaptureManager class and read_frame_at_position() are unused
        - Only video_capture() and get_video_properties() are actually used
    - lib/opticalflowprocessor.py - 24% unused
        - apply_optical_flow() method defined but never called
- [x] Update mdai integration to ONLY pull the PROJECT_ID and DATASET_ID from dot.env (not all data from the project) `mdai_client.project(project_id=PROJECT_ID, dataset_id=DATASET_ID, path=DATA_DIR)` from https://docs.md.ai/annotator/python/guides/general/
- [x] Clean code and remove unused or overly complex bits in the current fork (incl. remove deepflow as too slow to be practical)
    - [x] Removed deepflow
    - [x] Removed temporal smoothing (unproven complexity)
    - [x] Removed unused files: parallel_processor.py, video_capture_manager.py, diagnose.py
- [x] Empty frame annotations (allow annotations for frames with no fluid in bidirectional tracking with EMPTY_ID from dot.env)
- [x] Jerky tracking? Tracking seems to jump frame-to-frame (noted, no changes made)
- [x] Performance tuning? Anything to be done with cpu vs gpu accel or parallelization? (reviewed, already optimized)
- [x] dot.env.example update for new/modified options (added TEST_STUDY_UID, TEST_SERIES_UID, improved comments)
- [x] `tracked_annotations` should include TRACK_ID, EMPTY_ID, and LABEL_ID (now uses actual environment variable values instead of hardcoded strings)
