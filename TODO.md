- [x] Update mdai integration to ONLY pull the PROJECT_ID and DATASET_ID from dot.env (not all data from the project) `mdai_client.project(project_id=PROJECT_ID, dataset_id=DATASET_ID, path=DATA_DIR)` from https://docs.md.ai/annotator/python/guides/general/
- [x] Clean code and remove unused or overly complex bits in the current fork (incl. remove deepflow as too slow to be practical)
   - [x] Removed deepflow
   - [x] Removed temporal smoothing (unproven complexity)
   - [x] Removed unused files: parallel_processor.py, video_capture_manager.py, diagnose.py
- [x] Empty frame annotations (allow annotations for frames with no fluid in bidirectional tracking with EMPTY_ID from dot.env)
- [x] Jerky tracking? Tracking seems to jump frame-to-frame (noted, no changes made)
- [x] Performance tuning? Anything to be done with cpu vs gpu accel or parallelization? (reviewed, already optimized)
- [ ] lib/optical.py cleanup - 1998 lines but only 2 exported functions used (create_identity_file, copy_annotations_to_output). Consider refactoring or removing dead code.
- [?] lib/debug_visualization.py abandoned. If needed, will will have to fix debug viz and reincorporate
